For The Love of The Game

“Send them home, Brescia '' were the final words my football coach, Brian Griffin, said to us as we put our hands into the circle. It was the last game of our high school careers.  Brescia, our Quarterback, did just that with tears streaming down his cheeks. After he said “Go Devils,” everyone became emotional. I remember it so vividly. From the smeared face paint to the noise of the laces being untied for the last time, it was truly moving. When we headed out towards the buses with our equipment on our backs, I took one last glance at the illuminating stadium lights shining down onto the turf, and I took it all in. It was truly the end of one of the best experiences of my life.
