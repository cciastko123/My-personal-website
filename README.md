For The Love of The Game

“Send them home, **Brescia** '' were the final words my football coach, ![Brian Griffin](./http://coachgriffin.weebly.com), said to us as we put our hands into the circle. It was the last game of our high school careers.  Brescia, our Quarterback, did just that with tears streaming down his cheeks. After he said “Go Devils,” everyone became emotional. I remember it so vividly. From the smeared face paint to the noise of the laces being untied for the last time, it was truly moving. When we headed out towards the buses with our equipment on our backs, I took one last glance at the illuminating stadium lights shining down onto the turf, and I took it all in. It was truly the end of one of the best experiences of my life.

### It will motivate you

Before every game, **Jay Randle** or **Mike Franko**, would tell us “Boys this our time and we don't have much time left.  So, let's go out there and get this win, because it will be one of our last games for the rest of our careers”. Boy, that message sank in and really fired us up. Everyone in the locker room became loud and started banging on the lockers. My blood was racing through my veins. We were ready to go out there and play our hearts out. Due to special moments like these, you become more than just a bunch of guys playing a game, you become “brothers.” That's what made us so good. We knew each other's strengths and weaknesses. We knew everything about each other, and it definitely showed. 


### You Will Learn

I learned a lot from football. We did a lot of team bonding, which really increased my ability to work and thrive in a team setting. Everyone had their role and we learned to develop our individual talents. However, it was a team sport, and I learned it still took each one of us to make the team win. Football also improved my endurance, due to the grueling early morning workouts. Additionally, those workouts really set the wheels in motion for my appreciation of weight lifting. I enjoyed weight lifting, and learned it improved my performance on the field, as well. It lit a fire in me that I never knew I had. It was then, when lifting became my passion and I participate in it to this day. During the football season in high school, my alarm would go off at 6 a.m during the week, and I still sprang out of bed, threw on my workout clothes, and drove straight to the gym without hesitation. After the gym, I would come back home, shower and go back to school at 8 a.m. where I would workout again during P.E.  Then, after school, I’d have football practice from 3-5 p.m. This type of schedule was a grind, but I had fun doing it and learned how to work hard to achieve success.


### It Becomes Meaningful

The season was so long, yet it went by so fast. However, it was the ending that was truly special. When our coach told Brescia to send us home, the whole team broke down and had tears in their eyes. It was one of the most emotional moments of my life. When the game was over, the tears continued to run down my face, messing up all my face paint; and when I took my pads off for the last time in high school, my heart sank. The final moments really affected me. Being a part of this winning team was a wonderful ending to my high school career and something I will, truly, never forget. 

### It Will Shape You

Football taught me so much about my capabilities, physical fitness, and the benefits of hard work. It taught me that if I want to do great things, then I need to put in a lot of work. There is no other option. As mentioned previously, it led to my current passion of lifting weights, and how I plan to approach fitness for the rest of my life.  Currently, I work out lifting weights approximately six times a week at Mizzou, and do it for at least 1-2 hours a day. I’ve been working out ever since I played football in high school.  Not only have I spent a lot of time weight lifting in the gym, but I’ve also spent time educating myself on nutrition. I’ve been eating healthier, replacing fattening foods with healthier alternatives. Since this switch, I’ve been sleeping even better too. I’ve been more content and more driven, than ever before. Football taught me a lot, especially, that one needs to maintain the best version of themselves in order to be successful. I still have a love for football and have joined the flag football intramural teams in college over the last two years. Even though I can’t play contact football anymore, I can still find opportunities to put on my cleats and lace up.  Due to my continued weight lifting, I still have what it takes. Although, everytime I step foot on any football field the flashbacks from my high school days reappear in my head. Now, a small tear may streak down my face when I put on the flags. Football was truly an amazing experience and a huge part of who I am today.
