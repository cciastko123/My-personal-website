How It Happened

I'd like to take you back and provide the full story. Two years ago, I was a senior at Hinsdale Central H.S. and played for the varsity football team, and boy, were we good! However, it was the year when COVID was a major concern. COVID 19 affected our potential to achieve our dreams, because it made holding practices and games more difficult. We were only able to play six games instead of the usual twelve, but we didn’t let that stop us.  Luckily, our season was in the spring rather than the fall, so we were practicing for almost a full year.  We had tried to keep our skills up and just kept moving forward.  We went on to win six to zero, and we became number one in our conference and top five in the state. We beat out other large Chicago suburban schools such as:


1. Lyons Township
2. Oak Park-River Forest
3. York
4. Proviso West
5. Glenbard West
6. Leyden

We had blowouts in every game. Our starting defense didn’t allow a single touchdown over the entire season, ever. We were that good. However, it took a lot to be as good as we were. There was a lot of work that went into preparing for each game, and that made us who we were. 


Participating in the many late night practices in the dark, team lift sessions in the school gym for hours, pre-game “talks” in the locker room by the coach, and endless bus rides with my team members all made the time spent as a football player very special to me. Even the ride home after practices with my teammates was special. I remember during one practice Coach Griffin told us we were doing such a great job. He said that if we all could do just 20 pushups, then he would let us go home early. We accepted that challenge. We started as a group, down, up, “1” and so forth. We motivated each other as we pushed through. “Come on guys you can do it” shouted Brescia. “Don’t give up” yelled Jay. “Your mom didn't raise a quitter” screamed Franko. These were all inspiring words from our captains. Then, comes the 20th pushup. The last pushup was, probably, the hardest pushup of my life. Never, have I had my arms shaking so much. I almost gave up, but I kept pushing due to the motivation from my teammates. When we finished, we finished as a group. We were all drenched in sweat. The “high” was worth the extra effort.
