Before every game, Jay Randle or Mike Franko, would tell us “Boys this our time and we don't have much time left.  So, let's go out there and get this win, because it will be one of our last games for the rest of our careers”. Boy, that message sank in and really fired us up. Everyone in the locker room became loud and started banging on the lockers. My blood was racing through my veins. We were ready to go out there and play our hearts out. Due to special moments like these, you become more than just a bunch of guys playing a game, you become “brothers.” That's what made us so good. We knew each other's strengths and weaknesses. We knew everything about each other, and it definitely showed.
